# Beginner_Tutorials
 Tutorials for beginners.
Lesson_1 contains a set of examples of how varibles are declared and defined. 
These variables are of differing types and have different properties. 
Use this lesson to get to grips with the basic variables and operator types.

Lesson_2_Text_Adventure is an example of how to use the variables and logical
operators we covered in Lesson_1, as well as some new methods of output and input, 
to create a basic text adventure game. These lessons are created in Visual Studio, 
using Console Applications. The programing language is C#. 

Session 1 Homework Assignment: 
Use the text adventure program file I have create, (or create your own from scratch)
to flesh out our own version of a text adventure game. You can use any of the techniques
we have covered so far and any new things you learn along the way. There should be at least 3 
different branching points, (where the story can split into different paths). You can edit
the existing code and text any way you wish to. It is important to test your game frequently 
in order to spot bugs and resolve them. Contact me if you have any trouble, or feel like you
are stuck. I look forward to playing your game the next time we meet.
